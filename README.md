# 🕹️ **Rust Tic-Tac-Toe Game**

![Screenshot](Screenshot.png)

Welcome to the **Rust Tic-Tac-Toe Game**! 🎮 This is my **first Rust project**, created to practice and learn the fundamentals of the Rust programming language. It's a simple, console-based game of Tic-Tac-Toe where you can play against another player in your terminal. 😄

### 🚨 **Disclaimer**
This is my first attempt at Rust, so the code might not be the most efficient or idiomatic just yet. Please don't hesitate to open issues or make suggestions to improve the project. This code is a work-in-progress, and I hope to refine it as I continue learning Rust! 🚀

### 🚀 **How to Play**

- The game is played in your terminal with players taking turns to place their marks (X or O).
- Player **X** goes first, followed by player **O**.
- The game board is represented like this:

```
1 | 2 | 3
---------
4 | 5 | 6
---------
7 | 8 | 9
```

You simply enter the number (1-9) where you want to place your mark, and the game will update the board accordingly. ✨

**Objective**: The goal is to get three of your marks in a row—either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

### ✨ **Future Improvements**

Here are some ideas to enhance the game in future versions:

- **AI Opponent**: Implement an AI that can play against the user (perhaps using the minimax algorithm).
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Use a Rust GUI library like `druid` or `gtk-rs` to create a more interactive visual experience.
- **Multiplayer Online**: Add functionality to play against friends over the internet.

Feel free to contribute to these improvements or suggest new ones! 💡
